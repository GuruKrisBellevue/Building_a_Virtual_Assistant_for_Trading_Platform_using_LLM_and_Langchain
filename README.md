# Building a Virtual Assistant for Trading Platform using LLM and Langchain
The Project aims to enhance the Stock Trading experience by building a Virtual Assistant using LLM (Large Language Model) and Langchain technologies to make Mobile Stock Trading more accessible for Seniors and People with specific Disabilities, such as the Visual and hearing impaired. It also enhances the application's security by implementing Bio-Metric Authentication using Voice Recognition and Lip-Reading using Neural Networks and Deep Learning. Overall, the project intends to enhance the experience by limiting or eliminating the need for typing while accessing the trading platform, thus not requiring entering or remembering the credentials.
